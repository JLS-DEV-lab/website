Danny Schapeit and Jan Luca Sterta traveled to Würzburg yesterday to get to know the beautiful old town there. 

They were able to see a lot, and also got to know a lot about the people there, because the [Würzburg Residenzlauf](https://www.residenzlauf.de/) took place yesterday direct at the beautiful Residenz.

The two were able to get to know the old town as well as many sights in the beautiful weather and were positively surprised by Würzburg. They themselves said that it is definitely worth a trip there to look at the entire old town for a day.
